## Discription

The game is designed for two people (in the future I plan to increase the number of players) HOST and GUEST.

To **start** the game, you should message bot with '/start'.

After that, you will be prompted to **create** a room, or **enter** an existing one.

If you choose **"create" (Создать комнату)**, then you automatically become a **HOST**.
If you choose **"enter the room" (Войти в комнату)**, then you automatically become a **GUEST**.

After room is created and **GUEST** entered it, **HOST** will be asked to choose five topics for the game.
Total topics - 52.

After that the **game starts**. The bot sends a word to the player, reads the translation, and then sends
next word to another player. So until the words run out. At the end of the game, players will
be sent messages with correct and incorrect answers.
